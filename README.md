<h1 align="center"> Brain Tumor Classification </h>
<h4> A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties. Proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.

## :question: How to perform Image classification
1. Gathering your relevant data or you can dataset from kaggle.
2. Prepare your data using pre-processing techniques.
3. Perform image augmentation to get more images.
4. Creating a ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN) deep learning model.
5. Visualizing the results of your image classification.
